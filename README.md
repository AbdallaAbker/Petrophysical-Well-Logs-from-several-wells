Introduction to Dataset:Â¶
This dataset consists of petrophysical well logs from several wells. This is a relational dataset. You need to prepare data step by step as mentioned below and try to extract some insights and valuable information.

DEPTH_MD: This column is measured depth in meter. (Continuous data)
WELL: Well name (Categorical data)
X_LOC: Geographical X location in UTM system. (Continuous data)
Y_LOC: Geographical Y location in UTM system. (Continuous data)
GROUP: The interval of rocks that can include several FORMATION (Categorical data)
FORMATION: The interval of rocks that has geological special meaning (Categorical data)
DTC: This log is a measurement of acoustic wave in rocks inside oil and gas well (Continuous data)
PEF: This is photoelectric log helping to recognize lithology (Continuous data)
NPHI: This is a Neutron log for porosity evaluation. (Continuous data)
RHOB: This is rock medium density measurements(Continuous data)
lithology_name: type of the rocks (Categorical data)
